                    I heard a lot of NSCC IT Programming students start with Python, however we started with Java. I would like to learn this, I'm not quite sure if it's in our curriculum 
                    but regardless I think it would be important to know.

                    From what I've heard, Java Script knowledge is significantly more sought after than any basic CSS or HTML, and I want to make sure I learn the most important aspects 
                    to Web Development to help further myself

                <div class="maintext">
                    Despite having finished the Java Programming course, I feel as if there is still much to learn. I want to understand Object Oriented Programming better, I want to learn 
                    the ins and outs of Java and potentially make some graphic based applications.

                <div class="maintext">
                    I suppose this goes without saying, but I would like a programming job whenever one presents itself. I'm currently working at Sobeys while going to school and 
                    there's no amount of experience at Sobeys I can currently gain that will help my future.

                    This is more on the passion side, I love programming however I'm also very interested in Video Editing, and some of the products you can make with Adobe 
                    software is honestly flooring and something I want to try to get good at.
