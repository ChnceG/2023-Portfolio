                    After first semester, the programming language I'm familiar with is java. I started playing around with it in high school before getting back into it at NSCC, I really enjoy using it.
                    I still believe I have plenty to learn however I am pretty confident with it!

                    Just started learning C 2nd semester. Syntax has been a little difficult coming from mostly Java knowledge but it's getting easier

                    I've been enjoying working with HTML thoroughly, and website development in general. CSS is definitely easy to learn, but hard to master. I'm excited to continue learning
                    and improving as I use it more and more.

                    Just started learning the ins and outs of Linux 2nd semester. Getting used to the CLI has been a process as it's not something I'm used to, but I'm sure it'll be easier as time goes on

                    I think I have a pretty good knowledge on this. Not quite my favourite to work with however it's grown on me, it's been a process learning SQL and 
                    I still think there's plenty of room for growth.

                    Video editing is something I enjoy and have been picking at it off and on for a couple years. I want to learn how to go more in depth with the software however it's 
                    something I've become quite good with.
